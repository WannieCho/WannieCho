### 👋 Hey there!  
💡  I'm Wannie, rocking the IT service planning scene for over 7 years   
&emsp;&ensp;and now diving into the world of Systems Architecture (SA).   

🚀  I've crafted some cool remote access/support services   
&emsp;&ensp;and remote management systems for network devices.   

📈  I'm all about leveraging my networking and communications skills,   
&emsp;&ensp;and I'm currently leveling up with SA courses to bring even more to the table.   

🌐  Right now, I'm getting my hands dirty with On-premise setups and   
&emsp;&ensp;container orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes,   
&emsp;&ensp;while also exploring the vast skies of Cloud services.   

📞  Got questions or just wanna chat? Feel free to hit me up!   
&emsp;&ensp;Let's connect and grow together in this tech journey.
