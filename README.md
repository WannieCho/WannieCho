### 👋 Hey there!  
💡 I'm Wannie, rocking the IT service planning scene for over 7 years 
   and now diving into the world of Systems Architecture (SA).   

🚀 I've crafted some cool remote access/support services and 
   remote management systems for network devices.   

📈 I'm all about leveraging my networking and communications skills, 
   and I'm currently leveling up with SA courses to bring even more to the table.   

🌐 Right now, I'm getting my hands dirty with On-premise setups and 
   container orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes, 
   while also exploring the vast skies of Cloud services.   

📞 Got questions or just wanna chat? Feel free to hit me up!   
   Let's connect and grow together in this tech journey.
